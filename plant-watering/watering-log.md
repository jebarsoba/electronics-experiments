- **Very Wet (overwatered)**: <361

## Watering Entries

| Date | Time | Reading Before | Reading After | Water Added | Status |
|------|------|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 5 Oct | 19:29 | 509 | 361 | 100 cc | Dry â†’ Ideal |

## Notes
- Raw readings above 509 indicate dry soil requiring watering
- Readings between 361-508 indicate ideal soil moisture
- Readings below 361 indicate overwatered conditions
- The log tracks the sensor reading before and after watering to monitor effectiveness
